## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get started with the development mode for Project BAAS:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your development machine:

1. **Visual Studio 2022:** You'll need the latest version of Visual Studio 2022, which includes support for MAUI development. You can download it from the [Visual Studio website](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).

2. **.NET 6:** MAUI requires .NET 6, so make sure you have it installed. You can download it from the [official .NET website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0).

3. **MAUI Workload:** In Visual Studio 2022, make sure you've installed the MAUI workload. You can do this during installation or later via the Visual Studio Installer.

### Clone the Project

Next, clone the Project BAAS repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-baas.git
```

### Open the Project

1. Launch Visual Studio 2022.

2. Click on "Open a project or solution" and navigate to the directory where you cloned the Project BAAS repository.

3. Select the solution file (usually with a .sln extension) and open it.

### Build and Run

Now that you have the project open in Visual Studio, you can build and run it:

1. Select your target platform (Android, iOS, Windows, macOS) from the dropdown menu in the toolbar.

2. Click the "Start Debugging" button (usually a green arrow) or press F5 to build and run the app on your selected platform.

3. The app should launch in an emulator or on a physical device if one is connected.
